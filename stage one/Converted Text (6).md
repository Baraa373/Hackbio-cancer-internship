Lung cancer affects approximately 2.2 million patients annually, and due to drug resistance, 75% of patients die within five years. Machine learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence, is pivotal in predicting outcomes and enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning for lung cancer. This article delves into ML's role and its potential in lung cancer research.

Early detection of cancer reduces mortality rates, leading to the development of enhanced Computer-Aided Diagnosis and ML models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs analyze CT images to identify tumor regions. However, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) address the dataset overfitting issue often encountered by CNNs.

Omics sequencing datasets have emerged as a recent technological advancement employed for high-accuracy detection, overcoming the limitations of medical imaging datasets. This study explores the integration of omics datasets to improve early detection, tumor signature diagnosis, and subtype classification of lung cancers. Despite their high precision, feature selection remains a significant challenge in avoiding overfitting and improving model accuracy. Machine learning has enhanced survival prediction power compared to traditional physician-based approaches.

Immunotherapy has limited efficacy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors being used for treatment. AI models now analyze CT image data to predict immunotherapy responses. Deep learning methods such as CNNs and DeepTIL are used to assess tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. ML algorithms like NetMHC and NetMHCpan support personalized immunotherapies by predicting peptide-HLA binding for neoantigen identification. Vision Transformers and deep learning models are also tools for analyzing complex imaging and omics datasets.

Machine learning enables the integration of diverse data types, including imaging, omics, and clinical records. These data types often face challenges like platform noise, radionics data, and batch noise. Addressing batch effects and enhancing model generalizability and robustness are essential. Transfer learning and explainable AI tools are valuable techniques to improve model performance. Clinically significant metrics such as accuracy, Area Under the Curve (AUC), specificity, and sensitivity should be prioritized. By integrating this multimodal data into clinical decision-making tools, precision oncology, especially in lung cancer treatment, can be significantly advanced.

This article provides insight into the various machine learning and deep learning models that help reduce lung cancer mortality worldwide.
